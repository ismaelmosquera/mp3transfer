Mp3Client readme file

To run the client, execute the run.sh xcript if you are under a Linux like shell,
Or the run.bat file if you are under a MSWindows command line.
Since this is an application from the command line, you must go to this folder and
Execute the file as explained above.

Cd <path to this folder>

And execute the script according with your shell.
IMPORTANT: Before running the client, you must edit the run.sh and the run.bat files and change the host name for the one
where your server is running; in our case it is CAMPANILLA
as you can see in each script.
