Mp3 Server/Client readme file

As you can see, there are two applications; one for the server and another one for the client.
You must run the server first; the code is already built, but you can rebuild it if you want, to rebuild the application:

Execute the build.sh xcript if you are under a Linux like shell.
Execute the build.bat file if you are under a MSWindows command line.
 
The same is true if you wish to rebuild the client application.
After the server is executing, open another windows shell to execute the client.
You can execute the client and the server on the same machine, but you can also execute the server in a particular host and multiple clients in other machines, for instance, in a local network.
Please, see the readme.txt files in each folder ( mp3_server and mp3_client ) to know additional information before running the applications.
